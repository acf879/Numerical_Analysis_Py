# Numerical_Analysis
Currently single variable calculus will be able to input a function and use numerical derivatives, integration, evaluation, interpolation, and lines of best fit to analyze experimental data. Will eventually be extended to multivariable calculus. Currently only replaces certain expressions with the expressions from the math library. Will be fully compatible with libraries such as matplot, scipy, numpy, ect. Will have multiple options to perform numerical operations through algebraic equations, and through sensor data. This is due to the need to maybe having to differentiate, approximate,integrate or more for the numerical methods.
